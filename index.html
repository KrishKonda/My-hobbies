  <h3> I love to hike. Hiking is very fun and helps you release energy. Hiking also helps you excersise in a very fun way. Staying in nature helps people get happier and helps them be more relaxed. Hiking is also fun for me because I love plants and animals and when you are hiking you always see them Unlass you are hiking on mount Everest because it would be too cold.I like hiking because you can always imagine a story when you are hiking because you cannot do anything except to walk and think.</h3>
